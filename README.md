# AJSABQ_Input_File_Generator
An `ABAQUS` `.inp` file generator for shells of revolution written in Matlab with some MPI parallelism, used in much of my PhD (2007-2010) and post-doc (2010-2013) research. It's a complete mess (I would write it very differently now) and I don't remember what most of it does, but it can still be extremely useful to generate very complex shell models.

For instructions on how to get it running, see the `AJSABQ_drivrutin.m` file.
